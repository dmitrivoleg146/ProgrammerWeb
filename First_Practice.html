<h1>Vitalik Buterin</h1>
<p>Vitalik Buterin is a Russian-Canadian writer and programmer and has been involved in the Bitcoin community since
    2011, co-founding and writing articles for Bitcoin magazine. He is primarily known as the one behind Ethereum, a
    blockchain platform that operates as a world computer for
    <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-for-beginners/who-is-vitalik-buterin" target="_blanc">decentralized
        applications </a>.

    Buterin traveled around the world for six months in 2013 to speak with Bitcoin (BTC) developers. He understood that
    he could construct a new, possibly superior version by iterating on the Bitcoin blockchain. To explain this idea, he
    linked Bitcoin to a calculator and a future blockchain to a smartphone and applied the same principle of improving
    the system's strength by making it more general-purpose to blockchain networks. Bitcoin is the worldâ€™s first
    cryptocurrency, while Ether (ETH) is a digital currency based on the Ethereum blockchain network.

<h2>The birth of Ethereum</h2>
<p>In late 2013, Vitalik Buterin described his idea in a white paper, which he sent out to a few of his friends who
    shared it even more. As a result, about 30 people reached out to Vitalik to discuss the concept. Initially, the idea
    behind Ethereum was still very much about digital currency. Over time, the vision changed, and by the end of January
    2014, the team had realized that it is relatively easy to create decentralized file storage, and concepts like name
    registry can be brought to life with just a couple of lines of code.
